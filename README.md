An interactive 3D epidemic modeler to track and predict the H5N1 Avian
Influenza outbreak using compartmental models and generative agents.

For our primary projections, we use the SEIR compartmental model, a suitable
mathematical model of infectious disease spread which groups populations into
compartments of "susceptible," "exposed," "infected," or "recovered."

See the demo at <https://virion.youwen.dev>. Note that performance is quite
bad, it uses a lot of memory and takes a few moments to become responsive.
